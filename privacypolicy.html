    <h1>Arrival Privacy Policy</h1>
    <div class="legal-text-block">Privacy is a core value of Arrival. We intentionally don’t collect personal information like emails, names, or passwords. This allows us to collect anonymous analytics and usage information. Because your account is tied to a unique ID that isn’t linked to you, we can&#x27;t identify who uses which account. We anonymously collect usage, performance, and crash information in order to improve our app and better serve our users. Depending on which version of Arrival you are using this information may be shared with Google Analytics. Additionally, Arrival remembers which stations you have gone to in the past in order to show relevant to station suggestions. This information is never shared with any 3rd party. We only retain collected information for as long as necessary to provide you with your requested service. What data we store, we protect within commercially acceptable means to prevent loss and theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use or modification. Our app may link to external sites that are not operated by us. Please be aware that we have no control over the content and practices of these sites, and cannot accept responsibility or liability for their respective privacy policies. You are free to refuse our request for your personal information, with the understanding that we may be unable to provide you with some of your desired services. Your continued use of our website and app will be regarded as acceptance of our practices around privacy and personal information. If you have any questions about how we handle user data and personal information, feel free to contact us.<br><br>This policy is effective as of 13 February 2020.</div>
